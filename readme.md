# Housing Price Regression with Scikit-Learn
___
This notebook is my solution to the entry-level Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). The goal of this project is to predict housing prices given some data on the house (sqft, # bedrooms/bathrooms, yard space, etc.). This is a very well-explored topic, and my goal with this notebook is to experiment with different regression techniques in scikit-learn to find the best fit to the data.

The CSV files used for training and testing were provided by kaggle and can be found in the `datasets` folder.
